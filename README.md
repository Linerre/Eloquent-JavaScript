# Eloquent-JavaScript
## What and Why
This repository contains my solution code, chapter by chapter, for the exercises in the book *[Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)*.

It is my beginner guide on the JavaScript programming language. 
I chose it simply because of the recPractical Vimommendation from many people around. And as uaual I'm trying to finish as many exercies as I could
along my reading journey.

## Branches
I felt a need to test some ideas relevant to certain exercises from time to time. Whenever I found myself in such a situation, I would create a new branch to that end. 

For example, you may find there are several branches related to **chapter 6**. And each of these branch should have included a chapter-level `README` to explain more about the branch itself. 

**Chapter 6** is about *Object-Oriented Programming*, which I often found quite difficult for me to understand. So I have many commits when getting stuck in this area. 

Accasionally, a branch might be used for Git-learning purposes and there will be no chapter-level README. I'm thinking about deleting such branches to avoid confusion as much as possible but I may forget to sometimes. 

## demo file and project file
`demo` file is used solely for reviewing purposes. If a big chunk of code
contains a lot of methods that I am only familiar with  to some extent and need a
refresh, I will try out the some basics here. For exmaple, when I forget what
the `.slplt()` method will do to a string, I will test it here.

In the meanwhile, from **Chapter 7** the example code just becomes more
complicated and I need to follow the author line by line. Therefore, the best
way of learning is try to write the code myself and figure out what each line
does. The `project` file, not always with this word in its name, shows the
complete code for a program, with comments spread wherever I think necessary.

## My pain led me here
I have some experience coding in Python, and back to the time I was doing so, I just used a text editor and the `python` interpreter (`IPython` for example).

Soon I realized there is a crucial problme with this habit: **It is hard for me to track the changes I made while tesing on different ideas that I came up with.** Wrong ideas are just such a wonderful treasure that equally enlightens me.

What if there is a tool like the Microsoft Word that can track the history of changes. And hooray! Here comes Github!

## Why not complete?
This repo is work in slow progress because I'm a full-time staff member in a
research library and I have other languages to learn at the same time. But I am
determined to finish it.  


And this repository is created rightly for that purpose! I hope, in the end, I can see every attempt I made, be it successful or failed, because they are all worthy of being remembered. 


## Complaints
### Few Comments
The author tends to explain her code, not by using `javascript` comments,
through text right under a piece of code. This works most of the time, yet will
be more helpful if line comments is added to it. 
### Chapter 8 Errors and Exceptions
In this chapter the author suddenly started using `.prompt()` method, which, if
memory serves, has never appeared in previous chapters. This confuses me a lot!
The book from time to time uses something as if it was out of thin air, making
me wonder if this is a tutorial for beginners. 
### Chapter 9 Regular Expressions
It is hard for me to understand this:
```javascript
section = result[match[1]] = {}
```
Why on earth there are two `=` signs in an assignment expression? I have no idea
if the author once mentioned this before ...
