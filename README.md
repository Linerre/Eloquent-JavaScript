# Eloquent-JavaScript
This repository contains my solution code files for the exercises in the book Eloquent JavaScript.

*[Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)* is my beginner-guide book on the JavaScript programming language. 
I chose it simply because of the recommendation from many people. And as uaual I'm trying to finish as many exercies as I could
along my reading journey.

I have some experience coding in Python, and back to the time I was doing so, I just used a text editor and the `python` interpreter (`IPython` for example).

Soon I realized there is a crucial problme with this habit: **It is hard for me to track the changes I made while tesing on different ideas that I came up with.**

What if there is a tool like the MS Word that can track the history of changes. And hooray! Here comes Github!

And this repository is created rightly for that purpose! I hope, in the end, I can see every attemp I made, be it successful or failed, because they are all worthy of being remembered.
