# Eloquent-JavaScript
This repository contains my solution code, chapter by chapter, for the exercises in the book *[Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)*.

It is my beginner guide on the JavaScript programming language. 
I chose it simply because of the recommendation from many people around. And as uaual I'm trying to finish as many exercies as I could
along my reading journey.

I often found it quite difficult for me understand Object-Oriented Programming
(OOP). So I have many commits when getting stuck in this area. 

I have some experience coding in Python, and back to the time I was doing so, I just used a text editor and the `python` interpreter (`IPython` for example).

Soon I realized there is a crucial problme with this habit: **It is hard for me to track the changes I made while tesing on different ideas that I came up with.** Wrong ideas are just such a wonderful treasure that equally enlightens me.

What if there is a tool like the Microsoft Word that can track the history of changes. And hooray! Here comes Github!

This repo is work in slow progress because I'm a full-time staff member in a
research library and I have other languages to learn at the same time. But I am
determined to finish it.  

And this repository is created rightly for that purpose! I hope, in the end, I can see every attemp I made, be it successful or failed, because they are all worthy of being remembered.
