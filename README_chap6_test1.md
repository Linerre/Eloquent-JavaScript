## About this branch
I created this branch to test *one idea* relevant to the exercises in Chapter 6. Question 2, to be particulr. 

In the desciption of the exercise No.2 the author mentioned:
> Use `===`, or something equivalent such as `indexOf()`, to determin whether two value are the same.

For me this line just means: there are at least **two** ways out: One is to use `===` only and the other, `indexOf()` only.

I tried, if memory serves, around 3 or 4 days on figuring out the workaround for the first approach. 

This branch is exactly a result of that.

## Some complaint
However, it makes me a bit angry and frustrated as well that the author mentioned in *Hints*:
> The `includes` and `indexOf()` methods ...

Damn! This is the part of the book I hate most. It from time to time distracts me from the easiest way of finish a task.

Though I admit that JavaScript is such a language that one problem has mutiple solutions (it is good at this) and I can learn from all these different approaches, I just hate it when one thing is touched on arbitrarily (not seriously).
