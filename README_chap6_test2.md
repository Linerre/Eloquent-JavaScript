# About this branch
Nothing special here. I just tried `.includes()` method to solve the exercise 2, which is super easy and convienient compared with using mere `===` operator. 

For the latter you may want to check out the branch *chp6test1*. 

By the way, in the master branch, where the complete solutional code is stored and it uses the approach in the current branch.
