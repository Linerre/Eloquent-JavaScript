// A modular robot
// I'll skip this exercise for the time being (and probably forever), 
// because it is too big for me who is in a bit hurry to finish the book 
// and is expecting short, focused exercises instaed.
// Maybe in the future when I need to work out a module/package structure of my own,
// I'll review this drill and try to finish it. 

// Yet I strongly recommend readding the author's hints, which, again, is very
// thoughtful and inspiring. 

// Roads module
// Add dependencies and exports

  // Circular dependencies
  // This ex will be ignored too, because as far as I understand, it looks 
  // more like for fun. Anyway, the hints inspire and explain well. Read it.
