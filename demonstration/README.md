## What
In this folder I put files that contain exmaple code from the book, with
**comments** in `JavaScript`.

## Why
The author tends to use paragraphs under her code to explain. This works fine
most of the time since it, if not briefly, throws some light on what the code
does. **BUT** I from time to time felt confused by some lines of the code. And I
worked them out by putting **comments** around (often after indeed) the lines. 

## Imcomplete
Not all the dementration examples in the book are here. I only include those that baffles
me.
