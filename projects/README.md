#What
I put a list of files that have complete demo code in each *Project* chapter
from the book. 

The book, for better demostration, cut a whole program of dozens lines of code
to small chunks to make it easier for readers to understand the separate parts
of the programe. 

However, this inevitably turns another side of the understaning back--to have an idea of the whole program. I therefore think it's good to put together all the pieces of the code into a single file, *with comment* (which the code inherently lacks due to the author's explaination style).
